Both players flew to the event to pick up their last WCS Points and secure their Blizzcon Chances.</p>\n<p>If <a href=\"http://wcs.battle.net/sc2/en/players/fantasy\">Fantasy</a> lost then he would be knocked down to just 36.09% Blizzcon Chances; if <a href=\"http://wcs.battle.net/sc2/en/players/fantasy\">Fantasy</a> lost and <a href=\"http://wcs.battle.net/sc2/en/players/dark\">Dark</a> had won his match, then Fantasy would&#8217;ve been down to 0%. If Hyun lost then he&#8217;d have been knocked down to 0% as he needed at least a 2nd place. <a href=\"http://wcs.battle.net/sc2/en/players/hyun\">Hyun</a> getting a 2nd place would tie him with Fantasy, but Dark could still pass them, and a 1st place would&#8217;ve put Hyun at 100%.</p>\n<p>People have been counting out Hyun all year long, saying he only made it previously by competing in the easier WCS America. He made the SSL round of 16 twice this year, but still most of his points came from strong performances in international tournaments.</p>\n<p>Then Hyun defeated Fantasy 2-0, showing how much he wanted to make to Blizzcon.

A 4th place puts Fantasy at 84.68%.</p>\n<p>Dark needs at least a 16th place, which would put him at 35.44%. A 2nd place would put him at 92.14%, and a 1st locks him in at 100%.</p>\n<p>Hyun needs at least a 4th place, but that would only give him 10.23% Blizzcon Chances. A 2nd place would put Hyun at 34.44%, and a 1st place at 86.68%. If Hyun does win, he can still be knocked out if 2 out of sOs/Dear/Fantasy/Dark pass him.</p>\n<p>ForGG must get at least 2nd place, which would put him at 24.03%, and a 1st place puts him at 80.23%. If ForGG wins then he has to worry about the same thing Hyun would, 2 players out of sOs/Dear/Fantasy/Dark passing him.</p>\n<p>And let&#8217;s not forget about <a href=\"http://wcs.battle.net/sc2/en/players/dear\">Dear</a>, who would be 100% with winning GSL, or 0% with anything less.</p>\n<p>As far as the final standings for WCS points, we already have a few seeds locked in, and some close to being locked in. herO at #1, Maru at #2, and Parting at #3 are all locked in already. Life at #4, Polt at #11, Zest at #12, and Lilbow at #13 are all above 70% chances.</p>\n<p><b>Here are the current 10 most likely matches for the first round of the WCS Global Finals.</b></p>\n<p><strong>Life vs Lilbow</strong> has a 59.71% chance for the first round.</p>\n<p><b>Polt vs Hydra</b> has a 47.51% chance for the first round.</p>\n<p><b>PartinG vs Rogue</b> has a 44.68% chance for the first round.</p>\n<p><b>Dream vs Classic</b> has a 44.3% chance for the first round.</p>\n<p><b>Maru vs Rogue</b> has a 42.83% chance for the first round.</p>\n<p><b>Maru vs sOs</b> has a 39.31% chance for the first round.</p>\n<p><b>Rain vs Polt</b> has a 37.54% chance for the first round.</p>\n<p><b>herO vs FanTaSy</b> has a 35.64% chance for the first round.</p>\n<p><b>Life vs Zest</b> has a 29.89% chance for the first round.</p>\n<p><b>INnoVation vs Byu</b><strong>L</strong> has a 28.93% chance for the first round.</p>\n<p>Of course Dreamhack will have a big effect on these. Let&#8217;s look at some examples.</p>\n<p>If sOs wins Dreamhack, then he&#8217;s likely to face Hydra (at a 50.01% chance), instead of Maru or herO. Also Parting vs Lilbow would be locked in at 100%. Life vs Zest and Maru vs Rogue would both be around 75%.</p>\n<p>If sOs gets 2nd he&#8217;s likely to face Life. If he gets 4th then he&#8217;s likely to face Parting.</p>\n<p>If Fantasy wins, then he&#8217;s likely to face Life (75.41%) instead of herO. Parting vs Lilbow would be nearly locked in at 94.84%. Life vs Fantasy would be a 75.41% chance. Maru vs Rogue, sOs vs herO, and Polt vs Hydra would all be around 58% to 50%.</p>\n<p>If Fantasy gets 2nd in Dreamhack, then he&#8217;s likely to face Parting or Maru.</p>\n<p>If Hyun, Dark, or ForGG wins, then Life vs Lilbow is around a 75% chance.</p>\n<p>If Hyun wins then he&#8217;s likely to face herO (52.08%) or Maru (34.6%). Parting vs Rogue, Hyun vs herO, and Polt vs Hydra would be around 55% to 50%.</p>\n<p>If Dark wins then he&#8217;s very likely to face Parting (94.63%) instead of herO. Maru vs Rogue and sOs vs herO would both be around 53%. IF Dark gets 2nd then he&#8217;s likely to face Maru.</p>\n<p>If ForGG wins then he&#8217;s likely to face herO (45.59%) or Maru (34.64%). Parting vs Rogue and Polt vs Hydra would be around 55% to 50%.</p>\n<p>If Rain wins then we can see that his chances of facing Lilbow (75.35%) go up significantly instead of Polt or Zest. Life vs Zest and Rain vs Lilbow would be around 80% to 75%. Parting vs Rogue, Maru vs sOs, and Dream vs Hydra would be around 55% to 45%.</p>\n<p>And then if someone not going to Blizzcon wins, such as Solar, then Life vs Lilbow would be a 74.93% chance. Parting vs Rogue, Polt vs Hydra, and Maru vs sOs would be about 55% to 49%. Dream vs Classic, herO vs Fantasy, and Rain vs Polt would be about 45% to 42%. Maru vs Rogue, Innovation vs Zest, and Innovation vs Byul would be about 39% to 28%.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/dreamhacksc2\">DreamHack</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/gsl\">GSL</a> semifinals between Dear and ByuL both kick off at 2:30 am PDT on Thursday, September 24th, so we’re going to see the field narrowed down very quickly this week.

It seems he will probably not attend.</p>\n<p>4. <a href=\"http://wcs.battle.net/sc2/en/players/rogue\">Rogue</a> gets 4th or 2nd place in GSL. 4th place with no points from DreamHack would make him tied with Lilbow.</p>\n<p>5.

If Dark or Fantasy makes top 4 in DreamHack; or if ForGG, Hyun, or TY wins DreamHack; then sOs drops to around 67%. If Dear or Gumiho wins GSL, then sOs falls to about 70%.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wcs.battle.net/sc2/en/players/fantasy\">FanTaSy</a> <span style=\"color: #0052ff;\">72.34%</span> with 2,900 WCS Points.</p>\n<p>If Fantasy gets 8th in DreamHack then he goes up to 82.81%, however he would still have to worry about players passing him, a 4th place would be much safer at 98.19%. If Fantasy does get 8th place and Hyun, ForGG, TY, or Dark wins DreamHack, then Fantasy falls down to about 33%. If Fantasy gets 8th in DreamHack and Gumiho or Dear wins GSL, then Fantasy falls to about 36%.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #700000;\"><b>Over 5% &#8211; 3 Players</b></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wcs.battle.net/sc2/en/players/hyun\">HyuN</a> <span style=\"color: #700000;\">10.82%</span> with 2,525 WCS Points.</p>\n<p>To get nearly secured HyuN needs to win DreamHack Stockholm, which would put him at 97.53%. An 8th place would put him at 0%, 4th place at 20.75%, and a 2nd place at 49.41%. But if TY, Dark, Stats, ForGG, or Fantasy wins DreamHack then HyuN cannot qualify for Blizzcon.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wcs.battle.net/sc2/en/players/gumiho\">GuMiho</a> <span style=\"color: #700000;\">10.59%</span> with 2,225 WCS Points.</p>\n<p>If Gumiho wins GSL then he is nearly secured at 99.99%. If he gets 2nd place in GSL, then he would need at least a 16th place in DreamHack to go with it to have any chance, putting him at 44.31%, but again that&#8217;s unlikely due to the scheduling. If he gets 8th in GSL then the schedule should allow him the possiblity of going to DreamHack, he would need to win DreamHack to have any chance, and it would put him at 47.57%.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wcs.battle.net/sc2/en/players/dear\">Dear</a> <span style=\"color: #700000;\">8.52%</span> with 2,125 WCS Points.</p>\n<p>If Dear does not go to DreamHack, then he must win GSL, which would put him at 99.97%. If Dear manages to get 4th in GSL and win DreamHack then he goes up to 95.93%.
